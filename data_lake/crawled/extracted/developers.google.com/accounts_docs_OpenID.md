Page Summary

Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs support authentication and authorization, conforming to the OpenID Connect specification and are OpenID Certified.
To use Google's OAuth 2.0 for user login, you must set up a project in the Google Cloud Console to obtain credentials, set a redirect URI, and customize the user consent screen.
Authenticating a user involves obtaining and validating an ID token, commonly done through a "server" or "implicit" flow.
You can obtain additional user profile information and access other Google APIs by including relevant scopes in the authentication request and using the userinfo endpoint with an access token.
Google provides a Discovery document at a well-known URI containing configuration details and endpoint URIs for its OpenID Connect service.
Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs can be used for both authentication and authorization. This document
    describes our OAuth 2.0 implementation for authentication, which conforms to the
OpenID Connect
specification, and is
OpenID Certified
. The
    documentation found in
Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
    APIs
also applies to this service. If you want to explore this protocol interactively, we
    recommend the
Google OAuth 2.0 Playground
.
    To get help on
Stack Overflow
,
    tag your questions with 'google-oauth'.
Setting up OAuth 2.0
Before your application can use Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system for user login, you
    must set up a project in the
Google Cloud Console
to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials, set a
    redirect URI, and (optionally) customize the branding information that your users see on the
    user-consent screen. You can also use the Cloud Console to
    create a service account, enable billing, set up filtering, and do other tasks. For more
    details, see the
Google Cloud Console Help
.
Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials
You need OAuth 2.0 credentials, including a client ID and client secret, to authenticate users
    and gain access to Google's APIs.
To view the client ID and client secret for a given OAuth 2.0 credential, click the following
text:
Select
credential
. In the window that opens, choose your project and the credential you want, then
click
View
.
Or, view your client ID and client secret from the
Clients page
in
Cloud Console:
Go to the
Clients page
.
Click the name of your client or the edit (
create
) icon.
Your client ID and secret are at the top of the page.
Set a redirect URI
The redirect URI that you set in the Cloud Console determines
    where Google sends responses to your
authentication requests
.
To create, view, or edit the redirect URIs for a given OAuth 2.0 credential, do the
following:
Go to the
Clients page
.
Click on the client.
View or edit the redirect URIs.
If there is no listed client in the Clients page, then your project has
no OAuth credentials. To create one, click
Create client
.
Customize the user consent screen
For your users, the OAuth 2.0 authentication experience includes a consent screen that
    describes the information that the user is releasing and the terms that apply. For example, when
    the user logs in, they might be asked to give your app access to their email address and basic
    account information. You request access to this information using the
scope
parameter, which your app includes in its
authentication request
. You can also use scopes to request access
    to other Google APIs.
The user consent screen also presents branding information such as your product name, logo, and
    a homepage URL. You control the branding information in the
    Cloud Console.
To enable your project's consent screen:
Open the
Branding page
in the
  Google Cloud Console.
If prompted, select a project, or create a new one.
Fill out the form and click
Save
.
The following consent dialog shows what a user would see when a combination of OAuth 2.0 and
    Google Drive scopes are present in the request. (This generic dialog was generated using
    the
Google OAuth 2.0 Playground
,
    so it does not include branding information that would be set in the
    Cloud Console.)

Accessing the service
Google and third parties provide libraries that you can use to take care of many of the
    implementation details of authenticating users and gaining access to Google APIs. Examples
    include
Google Identity Services
and the
Google client libraries
, which are available for a variety of
    platforms.
If you choose not to use a library, follow the instructions in the remainder of this document,
    which describes the HTTP request flows that underly the available libraries.
Authenticating the user
Authenticating the user involves obtaining an ID token and validating it.
ID tokens
are a standardized feature of
OpenID Connect
designed for use in
    sharing identity assertions on the Internet.
The most commonly used approaches for authenticating a user and obtaining an ID token are
    called the "server" flow and the "implicit" flow. The server flow allows the backend server of
    an application to verify the identity of the person using a browser or mobile device. The
    implicit flow is used when a client-side application (typically a JavaScript app running in the
    browser) needs to access APIs directly instead of using its backend server.
This document describes how to perform the server flow for authenticating the user. The
    implicit flow is significantly more complicated because of security risks in handling and using
    tokens on the client side. If you need to implement an implicit flow, we highly recommend using
Google Identity Services
.
Server flow
Make sure you
set up your app in the
    Cloud Console
to enable it to use these protocols and
    authenticate your users. When a user tries to sign in with Google, you need to:
Create an anti-forgery state token
Send an authentication request to Google
Confirm the anti-forgery state token
Exchange
code
for access token and ID token
Obtain user information from the ID token
Authenticate the user
1. Create an anti-forgery state token
You must protect the security of your users by preventing request forgery attacks. The first
    step is creating a unique session token that holds state between your app and the user's client.
    You later match this unique session token with the authentication response returned by the
    Google OAuth Login service to verify that the user is making the request and not a malicious
    attacker. These tokens are often referred to as cross-site request forgery
    (
CSRF
)
    tokens.
One good choice for a state token is a string of 30 or so characters constructed using a
    high-quality random-number generator. Another is a hash generated by signing some of your
    session state variables with a key that is kept secret on your backend.
The following code demonstrates generating unique session tokens.
PHP
You must download the
Google APIs client library for PHP
to use this sample.
// Create a state token to prevent request forgery.
// Store it in the session for later validation.
$state = bin2hex(random_bytes(128/8));
$app['session']->set('state', $state);
// Set the client ID, token state, and application name in the HTML while
// serving it.
return $app['twig']->render('index.html', array(
'CLIENT_ID' => CLIENT_ID,
'STATE' => $state,
'APPLICATION_NAME' => APPLICATION_NAME
));
Java

2. Send an authentication request to Google
The next step is forming an HTTPS
GET
request with the appropriate URI parameters.
    Note the use of HTTPS rather than HTTP in all the steps of this process; HTTP connections are
    refused. You should retrieve the base URI from the
Discovery document
using the
authorization_endpoint
metadata value. The following discussion assumes
    the base URI is
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth
.
For a basic request, specify the following parameters:
client_id
, which you obtain from the
      Cloud Console
Clients page
.
response_type
, which in a basic authorization code flow request should be
code
. (Read more at
response_type
.)
scope
, which in a basic request should be
openid email
.
      (Read more at
scope
.)
redirect_uri
should be the HTTP endpoint on your server that will receive the
      response from Google. The value must exactly match one of the authorized redirect URIs for the
      OAuth 2.0 client, which you configured in the Cloud Console
      Credentials page. If this value doesn't match an authorized
      URI, the request will fail with a
redirect_uri_mismatch
error.
state
should include the value of the anti-forgery unique session token, as
      well as any other information needed to recover the context when the user returns to your
      application, e.g., the starting URL.
      (Read more at
state
.)
nonce
is a random value generated by your app that enables replay protection
      when present.
login_hint
can be the user's email address or the
sub
string,
      which is equivalent to the user's Google ID. If you don't provide a
login_hint
and the user is logged in, the consent screen includes a request for approval to
      release the user's email address to your app.
      (Read more at
login_hint
.)
Use the
hd
parameter to optimize the OpenID Connect flow for users of a
      particular domain associated with a Google Workspace or Cloud organization (read more at
hd
).
Here is an example of a complete OpenID Connect authentication URI, with line breaks and spaces
    for readability:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
 response_type=code&
 client_id=
424911365001.apps.googleusercontent.com
&
 scope=openid
%20email
&
 redirect_uri=
https%3A//developers.google.com/oauthplayground
&
 state=
security_token%3D138r5719ru3e1%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Foauth2-login-demo.example.com%2FmyHome
&
 login_hint=
jsmith@example.com
&
 nonce=
0394852-3190485-2490358
&
 hd=
example.com
Users are required to give consent if your app requests any new information about them, or if
    your app requests account access that they have not previously approved.
3. Confirm anti-forgery state token
The response is sent to the
redirect_uri
that you specified in the
request
. All responses are returned in the query string:
https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground?state=
security_token%3D138r5719ru3e1%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Foa2cb.example.com%2FmyHome
&code=
4/P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7
&scope=openid%20email%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
Per RFC 6749, clients MUST ignore unrecognized response parameters. On the server, you must
    confirm that the
state
received from Google matches the session token you created
    in
Step 1
. This round-trip verification helps to verify that the
    user, not a malicious script, is making the request.
The following code demonstrates confirming the session tokens that you created in Step 1:
PHP
You must download the
Google APIs client library for PHP
to use this sample.
// Ensure that there is no request forgery going on, and that the user
// sending us this connect request is the user that was supposed to.
if ($request->get('state') != ($app['session']->get('state'))) {
return new Response('Invalid state parameter', 401);
}
Java

to use this sample.
// Ensure that there is no request forgery going on, and that the user

4. Exchange
code
for access token and ID token
The response includes a
code
parameter, a one-time authorization code that your
    server can exchange for an access token and ID token. Your server makes this exchange by sending
    an HTTPS
POST
request. The
POST
request is sent to the token endpoint,
    which you should retrieve from the
Discovery document
using the
token_endpoint
metadata value. The following discussion assumes the endpoint is
https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
. The request must include the following parameters in
    the
POST
body:
Fields
code
The authorization code that is returned from
the initial request
.
client_id
The client ID that you obtain from the Cloud Console
Clients page
, as described in
Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials
.
client_secret
The client secret that you obtain from the Cloud Console
Clients page
, as described in
Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials
.
redirect_uri
An authorized redirect URI for the given
client_id
specified in the
          Cloud Console
Clients page
, as described in
Set a redirect URI
.
grant_type
This field must contain a value of
authorization_code
,
as defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification
.
The actual request might look like the following example:
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: oauth2.googleapis.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

code=
4/P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7
&
client_id=
your-client-id
&
client_secret=
your-client-secret
&
redirect_uri=
https%3A//developers.google.com/oauthplayground
&
grant_type=authorization_code
A successful response to this request contains the following fields in a JSON array:
Fields
access_token
A token that can be sent to a Google API.
expires_in
The remaining lifetime of the access token in seconds.
id_token
A
JWT
that contains
          identity information about the user that is digitally signed by Google.
scope
The scopes of access granted by the
access_token
expressed as a list of
          space-delimited, case-sensitive strings.
token_type
Identifies the type of token returned. At this time, this field always has the value
Bearer
.
refresh_token
(optional)
This field is only present if the
access_type
parameter was set to
offline
in the
authentication request
.
            For details, see
Refresh tokens
.
5. Obtain user information from the ID token
An ID Token is a
JWT
(JSON Web Token), that is, a cryptographically signed Base64-encoded JSON object. Normally, it
    is critical that you
validate an ID token
before you use it,
    but since you are communicating directly with Google over an intermediary-free HTTPS channel and
    using your client secret to authenticate yourself to Google, you can be confident that the token
    you receive really comes from Google and is valid. If your server passes the ID token to other
    components of your app, it is extremely important that the other components
validate the token
before using it.
Since most API libraries combine the validation with the work of decoding the base64url-encoded
    values and parsing the JSON within, you will probably end up validating the token anyway as you
    access the claims in the ID token.
An ID token's payload
An ID token is a JSON object containing a set of name/value pairs. Here's an example, formatted
    for readability:
{
"iss"
:
"https://accounts.google.com"
,
"azp"
:
"1234987819200.apps.googleusercontent.com"
,
"aud"
:
"1234987819200.apps.googleusercontent.com"
,
"sub"
:
"10769150350006150715113082367"
,
"at_hash"
:
"HK6E_P6Dh8Y93mRNtsDB1Q"
,
"hd"
:
"example.com"
,
"email"
:
"jsmith@example.com"
,
"email_verified"
:
"true"
,
"iat"
:

,
"exp"
:
1353604926
,
"nonce"
:
"0394852-3190485-2490358"
}
Google ID Tokens may contain the following fields (known as
claims
):
Claim
Provided
Description
aud
always
The audience that this ID token is intended for. It must be one of the OAuth 2.0 client
          IDs of your application.
exp
always
Expiration time on or after which the ID token must not be accepted. Represented in
          Unix epoch time (integer seconds).
iat
always
The time the ID token was issued. Represented in Unix epoch time (integer seconds).
iss
always
The Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. Always
https://accounts.google.com
or
accounts.google.com
for Google
          ID tokens.
sub
always
An identifier for the user, unique among all Google Accounts and never reused. A Google
          Account can have multiple email addresses at different points in time, but the
sub
value is never changed. Use
sub
within your application
          as the unique-identifier key for the user. Maximum length of 255 case-sensitive ASCII
          characters.
auth_time
The time user authentication took place, a JSON number representing the number of
          seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Provided
          when the
auth_time
claim is included in the
          authentication request and enabled in
settings
.
at_hash
Access token hash. Provides validation that the access token is tied to the identity
          token. If the ID token is issued with an
access_token
value in the server
          flow, this claim is always included. This claim can be used as an alternate mechanism to
          protect against cross-site request forgery attacks, but if you follow
Step 1
and
Step 3
it is not
          necessary to verify the access token.
azp
The
client_id
of the authorized presenter. This claim is only needed when
          the party requesting the ID token is not the same as the audience of the ID token. This
          may be the case at Google for hybrid apps where a web application and Android app have a
          different OAuth 2.0
client_id
but share the same Google APIs project.
email
The user's email address. Provided only if you included the
email
scope in
          your request. The value of this claim may not be unique to this account and could change
          over time, therefore you shouldn't use this value as the primary identifier to link to
          your user record. You also can't rely on the domain of the
email
claim to
          identify users of Google Workspace or Cloud organizations; use the
hd
claim
          instead.
email_verified
True if the user's email address has been verified; otherwise false.
family_name
The user's surname(s) or last name(s). Might be provided when a
name
claim is present.
given_name
The user's given name(s) or first name(s). Might be provided when a
name
claim is present.
hd
The domain associated with the Google Workspace or Cloud organization of the user.
          Provided only if the user belongs to a Google Cloud organization.  You must check this
          claim when restricting access to a resource to only members of certain domains. The
          absence of this claim indicates that the account does not belong to a Google hosted
          domain.
locale
The user's locale, represented by a
BCP 47
language tag.
          Might be provided when a
name
claim is
          present.
name
The user's full name, in a displayable form. Might be provided when:
The request scope included the string "profile"
The ID token is returned from a token refresh
When
name
claims are present, you can use them to update your app's user
            records. Note that this claim is never guaranteed to be present.
nonce
The value of the
nonce
supplied by your app in the authentication request.
          You should protect against replay attacks by presenting this value only once.
picture
The URL of the user's profile picture. Might be provided when:
The request scope included the string "profile"
The ID token is returned from a token refresh
When
picture
claims are present, you can use them to update your app's
            user records. Note that this claim is never guaranteed to be present.
profile
The URL of the user's profile page. Might be provided when:
The request scope included the string "profile"
The ID token is returned from a token refresh
When
profile
claims are present, you can use them to update your app's
            user records. Note that this claim is never guaranteed to be present.
6. Authenticate the user
After obtaining user information from the ID token, you should query your app's user database.
    If the user already exists in your database, you should start an application session for that
    user if all login requirements are met by the Google API response.
If the user does not exist in your user database, you should redirect the user to your new-user
    sign-up flow. You may be able to auto-register the user based on the information you receive
    from Google, or at the very least you may be able to pre-populate many of the fields that you
    require on your registration form. In addition to the information in the ID token, you can get
    additional
user profile information
at our user
    profile endpoints.
Advanced topics
The following sections describe the Google OAuth 2.0 API in greater detail. This information is
    intended for developers with advanced requirements around authentication and authorization.
Access to other Google APIs
One of the advantages of using OAuth 2.0 for authentication is that your application can get
    permission to use other Google APIs on behalf of the user (such as YouTube, Google Drive,
    Calendar, or Contacts) at the same time as you authenticate the user. To do this, include the
    other scopes that you need in the
authentication request
that you
    send to Google. For example, to add user's age group to your authentication request, pass a
    scope parameter of
openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/profile.agerange.read
. The user is
    prompted appropriately on the
consent screen
. The access
    token that you receive back from Google will let your application access all the APIs related to
    the scopes of access you requested and were granted.
Refresh tokens
In your request for API access you can request a refresh token to be returned during the
code
exchange
. A refresh token provides your app
    continuous access to Google APIs while the user is not present in your application. To request a
    refresh token, add set the
access_type
parameter to
offline
in
    your
authentication request
.
Considerations:
Be sure to store the refresh token safely and permanently, because you can only obtain a
      refresh token the first time that you perform the code exchange flow.
There are limits on the number of refresh tokens that are issued: one limit per client/user
      combination, and another per user across all clients. If your application requests too many
      refresh tokens, it may run into these limits, in which case older refresh tokens stop
      working.
For more information, see
Refreshing an access token
      (offline access)
.
Prompting re-consent
You can prompt the user to re-authorize your app by setting the
prompt
parameter to
consent
in your
authentication request
. When
prompt=consent
is
    included, the consent screen is displayed every time your app requests authorization of scopes
    of access, even if all scopes were previously granted to your Google APIs project. For this
    reason, include
prompt=consent
only when necessary.
For more about the
prompt
parameter, see
prompt
in the
Authentication URI parameters
table.

          one of the authorized redirect values that you set in the
          Cloud Console
Clients page
(including the HTTP or HTTPS scheme,
          case, and trailing '/', if any).
scope
(Required)
The scope parameter must begin with the
openid
value and then include
          the
profile
value, the
email
value, or both.
If the
profile
scope value is present, the ID token might (but is not
            guaranteed to) include the user's default
profile
claims.
If the
email
scope value is present, the ID token includes
email
and
email_verified
claims.
In addition to these OpenID-specific scopes, your scope argument can also include other
            scope values. All scope values must be space-separated. For example, if you wanted
            per-file access to a user's Google Drive, your scope parameter might be
openid profile email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
.
For information about available scopes, see
OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs
or the
            documentation for the Google API you would like to use.
state
(Optional, but strongly recommended)
An opaque string that is round-tripped in the protocol; that is to say, it is
          returned as a URI parameter in the Basic flow, and in the URI
#fragment
identifier in the Implicit flow.
The
state
can be useful for correlating requests and responses.
            Because your
redirect_uri
can be guessed, using a
state
value
            can increase your assurance that an incoming connection is the result of an
            authentication request initiated by your app. If you
generate a random string
or encode the hash of some
            client state (e.g., a cookie) in this
state
variable, you can validate
            the response to verify that the request and response originated in the same browser. This
            provides protection against attacks such as cross-site request forgery.
access_type
(Optional)
The allowed values are
offline
and
online
. The effect is
          documented in
Offline Access
; if an access
          token is being requested, the client does not receive a refresh token unless a value of
offline
is specified.
claims
(Optional)
The
claims parameter
is used to specify one or more optional fields to include in the
          userinfo endpoint or authentication request ID token response types. The value is a JSON
          object containing the response type and requested claims. The following claim requests
          are accepted by Google servers:
Claim requests
auth_time
Request the time when the user was last authenticated. To return
auth_time
as a field in the ID token response, include the
claims
request parameter:
claims={"id_token":{"auth_time":{"essential":true}}}
Must be enabled in
settings
.
display
(Optional)
An ASCII string value for specifying how the authorization server displays the
          authentication and consent user interface pages. The following values are specified, and
          accepted by the Google servers, but don't have any effect on protocol flow behavior:
page
,
popup
,
touch
, and
wap
.
hd
(Optional)
Streamline the login process for accounts owned by a Google Cloud organization. By
          including the Google Cloud organization domain (for example,
mycollege.edu
),
          you can indicate that the account selection UI should be optimized for accounts at that
          domain. To optimize for Google Cloud organization accounts generally instead of just one
          Google Cloud organization domain, set a value of an asterisk (
*
):
hd=*
.
Don't rely on this UI optimization to control who can access your app, as client-side
            requests can be modified. Be sure to
validate
that
            the
returned ID token
has an
hd
claim value
            that matches what you expect (e.g.
mycolledge.edu
). Unlike the request
            parameter, the ID token
hd
claim is contained within a security token from
            Google, so the value can be trusted.
include_granted_scopes
(Optional)
If this parameter is provided with the value
true
, and the authorization request
    is granted, the authorization will include any previous authorizations granted to this
    user/application combination for other scopes; see
Incremental authorization
.
Note that you cannot do incremental authorization with the Installed App flow.
login_hint
(Optional)
When your app knows which user it is trying to authenticate, it can provide this
          parameter as a hint to the authentication server. Passing this hint suppresses the account
          chooser and either pre-fills the email box on the sign-in form, or selects the proper
          session (if the user is using
multiple sign-in
),
          which can help you avoid problems that occur if your app logs in the wrong user account.
          The value can be either an email address or the
sub
string, which is
          equivalent to the user's Google ID.
prompt
(Optional)
A space-delimited list of string values that specifies whether the authorization server
          prompts the user for reauthentication and consent. The possible values are:
none
The authorization server does not display any authentication or user consent
                screens; it will return an error if the user is not already authenticated and has
                not pre-configured consent for the requested scopes. You can use
none
to check for existing authentication and/or consent.
consent
The authorization server prompts the user for consent before returning information
                to the client.
select_account
The authorization server prompts the user to select a user account. This allows a
                user who has multiple accounts at the authorization server to select amongst the
                multiple accounts that they may have current sessions for.
If no value is specified and the user has not previously authorized access, then the
            user is shown a consent screen.
hl
(Optional)
A
BCP 47
language tag used to specify
          the display language for the sign-in, account chooser, and consent screens. If this
          parameter is not provided, the language defaults to the user's Google Account or browser
          settings. For example, to request the UI in British English, set the parameter to
en-GB
.
Validating an ID token
You need to validate all ID tokens on your server unless you know that they came directly from
    Google. For example, your server must verify as authentic any ID tokens it receives from your
    client apps.
The following are common situations where you might send ID tokens to your server:
Sending ID tokens with requests that need to be authenticated. The ID tokens tell you the
      particular user making the request and for which client that ID token was granted.
ID tokens are sensitive and can be misused if intercepted. You must ensure that these tokens
    are handled securely by transmitting them only over HTTPS and only using POST data or within
    request headers. If you store ID tokens on your server, you must also store them securely.
One thing that makes ID tokens useful is that fact that you can pass them around different
    components of your app. These components can use an ID token as a lightweight authentication
    mechanism authenticating the app and the user. But before you can use the information in the
    ID token or rely on it as an assertion that the user has authenticated, you
must
validate it.
Validation of an ID token requires several steps:
Verify that the ID token is properly signed by the issuer. Google-issued tokens are signed
      using one of the certificates found at the URI specified in the
jwks_uri
metadata
      value of the
Discovery document
.
Verify that the value of the
iss
claim in the ID token is equal to
https://accounts.google.com
or
accounts.google.com
.
Verify that the value of the
aud
claim in the ID token is equal to your app's
      client ID.
Verify that the expiry time (
exp
claim) of the ID token has not passed.
If you specified a
hd parameter
value in the request, verify that
      the ID token has a
hd
claim that matches an accepted domain associated with a
      Google Cloud organization.
Steps 2 to 5 involve only string and date comparisons which are quite straightforward, so we
    won't detail them here.
The first step is more complex, and involves cryptographic signature checking. For
debugging
purposes, you can use Google's
tokeninfo
endpoint to compare
    against local processing implemented on your server or device. Suppose your ID token's value is
XYZ123
. Then you would dereference the URI
https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo?id_token=
XYZ123
. If the token
    signature is valid, the response would be the JWT payload in its decoded JSON object form.
The
tokeninfo
endpoint is useful for debugging but for production
    purposes, retrieve Google's public keys from the keys endpoint and perform the validation
    locally. You should retrieve the keys URI from the
Discovery document
using the
jwks_uri
metadata value. Requests to the debugging endpoint may be
    throttled or otherwise subject to intermittent errors.
Since Google changes its public keys only infrequently, you can cache them using the cache
    directives of the HTTP response and, in the vast majority of cases, perform local validation
    much more efficiently than by using the
tokeninfo
endpoint. This validation
    requires retrieving and parsing certificates, and making the appropriate cryptographic calls to
    check the signature. Fortunately, there are well-debugged libraries available in a wide variety
    of languages to accomplish this (see
jwt.io
).
Obtaining user profile information
To obtain additional profile information about the user, you can use the access token
    (which your application receives during the
authentication flow
) and the
OpenID Connect
standard:
To be OpenID-compliant, you must include the
openid profile
scope values in your
authentication request
.
If you want the user's email address to be included, you can specify an additional scope
        value of
email
.
        To specify both
profile
and
email
, you can include the following
        parameter in your authentication request URI:
scope=openid%20profile%20email
Add your access token to the authorization header and make an HTTPS
GET
request
      to the userinfo endpoint, which you should retrieve from the
Discovery document
using the
userinfo_endpoint
metadata
      value. The userinfo response includes information about the user, as described in
OpenID Connect Standard Claims
and the
claims_supported
metadata value of the Discovery document. Users or their
      organizations may choose to supply or withhold certain fields, so you might not get
      information for every field for your authorized scopes of access.
The Discovery document
The OpenID Connect protocol requires the use of multiple endpoints for authenticating users,
  and for requesting resources including tokens, user information, and public keys.
To simplify implementations and increase flexibility, OpenID Connect allows the use of a
  "Discovery document," a JSON document found at a well-known location containing key-value pairs
  which provide details about the OpenID Connect provider's configuration, including the URIs of the
  authorization, token, revocation, userinfo, and public-keys endpoints.
  The Discovery document for Google's OpenID Connect service may be retrieved from:
https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
To use Google's OpenID Connect services, you should hard-code the Discovery-document URI
  (
https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
) into your application.
  Your application fetches the document, applies caching rules in the response, then retrieves
  endpoint URIs from it as needed. For example, to authenticate a user, your code would retrieve the
authorization_endpoint
metadata value
  (
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth
in the example below)
  as the base URI for authentication requests that are sent to Google.
Here is an example of such a document; the field names are those specified in
OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
(refer to that document for their meanings).
  The values are purely illustrative and might change, although they are copied from a recent
  version of the actual Google Discovery document:
{
"issuer"
:
"https://accounts.google.com"
,
"authorization_endpoint"
:

}
You may be able to avoid an HTTP round-trip by caching the values from the Discovery document.
  Standard HTTP caching headers are used and should be respected.
