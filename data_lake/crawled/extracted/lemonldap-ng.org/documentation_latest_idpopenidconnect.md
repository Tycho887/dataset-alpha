Note
OpenID Connect is a protocol based on REST, OAuth 2.0 and JOSE
stacks. It is described here:
http://openid.net/connect/
.
LL::NG can act as an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). It will reply to
OpenID Connect requests to give user identity (through ID Token) and
information (through UserInfo endpoint).
As an OP, LL::NG supports many OpenID Connect features:
Authorization Code, Implicit and Hybrid flows
Publication of JSON metadata and JWKS data (Discovery)
prompt
,
display
,
ui_locales
,
max_age
parameters
Mapping custom scope values to non-standard claims

Configuration of Relying Party in LL::NG

Go in Manager and click on
OpenID
Connect
Relying
Parties
, then
click on
Add
OpenID
Relying
Party
. Set a technical name
(without space or special character), like “sample-rp”;
You can then set this RP configuration.
Basic options

Public client
(since version
2.0.4
): Set this RP as public
client, so authentication is not needed on tokens endpoint. Set this for
mobile apps or native Javascript apps.
Client ID
: Client ID for this RP
Client secret
: Client secret for this RP (can be used for
symmetric signature)
Allowed redirection addresses for login
: Space-separated list of redirect
addresses allowed for this RP
Exported attributes (claims)

Changed in version 2.0.16:
All exported attributes are sent if
Always send exported attributes
option is enabled in
OpenID Connect Service
. In previous versions, you had to declare them in
Options
/
Scope
/
Scope Values content
too.
For each OpenID Connect attribute you want to expose to applications, you can define:
Claim name
: Name of the attribute as it will appear in Userinfo responses
Variable name
: Name of the LemonLDAP::NG session variable containing the attribute value
Type
: Attribute data type. By default, it is a string. Choosing integer or boolean will make the attribute appear as the corresponding JSON type.
Array
: Select how multi-valued attributes are processed
Automatic
: If the session key contains a single value, it will be released as a JSON number, string or boolean, depending on the previously specified type. If the session key contains multiple values, it will be released as an array of numbers, strings or booleans.
Always
: Return an array even if the attribute only contains one value
Never
: If the session key contains a single value, it will be released as a JSON number, string or boolean. If the session key contains multiple values, it will be released as a single string with a separator character.
Attention
The specific
sub
attribute is not defined here, but in
User
attribute
parameter (see below).
Options

Advanced
Bypass consent
: Enable if you never want to display the scope
sharing consent screen (consent will be accepted by default).
Bypassing the consent is
not
compliant with OpenID Connect
standard.
Force claims to be returned in ID Token
: This options will
make user attributes from the requested scope appear as ID Token claims
Use JWT format for Access Token
(since version
2.0.12
): When
using this option, Access Tokens will use the JWT format, which means they
can be verified by external OAuth2.0 resource servers without using the
Introspection or UserInfo endpoint.
Release claims in Access Token
(since version
2.0.12
): If Access
Tokens are in JWT format, this option lets you release the claims defined
in the
Extra Claims
section inside the Access Token itself
Use refresh tokens
(since version
2.0.7
): If this option
is enabled, LL::NG will issue a Refresh Token that can be used
to obtain new access tokens as long as the user session is still
valid
User attribute
: Session field that will be used as main
identifier (
sub
). Default value is
whatToTrace
.
Additional audiences
(since version
2.0.8
): You can
specify a space-separated list of audiences that will be added to the
ID Token audiences, and possibly the access token audiences if the
access token format is JWT
Other RP allowed to exchange access_token
(since version
2.20.0
):
You can specify a space-separated list of Relying-Party allowed to ask
for a token exchange. See
OpenID-Connect Token Exchange

(since version
2.0.4
): A code challenge is
required at Tokens endpoint (see
RFC 7636
)
Invalidate refresh tokens after use
(since version
2.20.0
): Use
this option to prevent Refresh Tokens from being re-used. A new refresh
token will be generated every time.
Allow offline access
(since version
2.0.7
): After enabling
this feature, an application may request the
offline_access
scope, and will obtain a Refresh Token that persists even after
the user has logged off. See
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess
for details. These offline sessions can be administered through
the Session Browser.
Allow Native SSO for Mobile Apps
(since version
2.21.0
): Allow
relying party to request a
device_secret
. See
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html
for details.
Allow OAuth2.0 Password Grant
(since version
2.0.8
): Allow the use of
the
Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
by this client.
This feature only works if you have configured a form-based authentication module.
Allow OAuth2.0 Client Credentials Grant
(since version
2.0.11
): Allow the use of the
Client Credentials Grant
by this client.
Allowed URLs for fetching Request Object
: (since version
2.17.1

userinfo endpoint authentication using header only
:
Algorithms
Access Token signature algorithm
(since version
2.0.12
): Select
one of the available public key signature algorithms
Access Token Encryption key management algorithm
: If Relying-Party require access_token encryption, set here the key management algorithm
Access Token Encryption content encryption algorithm
: If Relying-Party require access_token encryption, set here the content encryption algorithm
ID Token signature algorithm
: Select one of the available public key
(RSXXX) or HMAC (HSXXX) based signature algorithms
ID Token Encryption key management algorithm
: If Relying-Party require id_token encryption, set here the key management algorithm
ID Token Encryption content encryption algorithm
: If Relying-Party require id_token encryption, set here the content encryption algorithm
UserInfo response format
(since version
2.0.12
): By default,
UserInfo is returned as a simple JSON object. You can also choose to
return it as a JWT, using one of the available signature algorithms.
User_info Encryption key management algorithm
: If Relying-Party require user_info response encryption, set here the key management algorithm
User_info Encryption content encryption algorithm
: If Relying-Party require user_info response encryption, set here the content encryption algorithm
Logout Encryption key management algorithm
: If Relying-Party require back-channel-logout token encryption, set here the key management algorithm
Logout Encryption content encryption algorithm
: If Relying-Party require back-channel-logout token encryption, set here the content encryption algorithm
Keys
JWKS URI
: When Relying-Party require encryption, set here the relying-party endpoint where keys are published
JWKS Data
: Alternative, fix here the relying-party JWKS document
Signing key name
: Since
2.22.0
, lets you use a
different key
for signing tokens. If you specify multiple
values separated by a comma, the first key will be used for signing, and the
others will be published in metadata if you use the
/oauth2/jwks?client_id=<clientid>
endpoint
Important
JWKS URI MUST be reachable by Portal to fetch JWKS document
Timeouts
Authorization Codes
(default: one minute)
: Expiration time of
Authorization Codes, when using the Authorization Code flow.
ID Tokens
(default: one hour)
: Expiration time of ID Tokens.
Access Tokens
(default: one hour)
: Expiration time
of Access Tokens.
Offline sessions
(default: one month)
: Lifetime of the
refresh token obtained with the
offline_access
scope.
This parameter only applies if offline sessions are enabled.
refresh_token activity timeout
(default: none)
: Expiration time
of inactives refresh tokens. if no value is set, activity isn’t tracked.
Important
When enabling
refresh_token activity timeout
, a refresh_token created
with a version of LLNG previous to 2.22.0 and never used after update
is considered as active
(because it has no activity field)
.
Such totally inactive refresh_token will be purged normally at their
normal end-of-life. Any use of a refresh_token updates the activity field.
Logout
Bypass confirm
: Bypass logout confirmation when logout is initiated
by relying party
Session required
: Whether to send the Session ID
(sid)
in the logout
request
(Front and Back Channel)
Type
: Type of logout to perform
URL
: Specify the relying party’s logout URL
Allowed redirection addresses for logout
: A space-separated list of
URLs that this client can redirect the user to once the logout is done
(through
post_logout_redirect_uri
)
Comment
: set a comment
Macros

You can define here macros that will be only evaluated for this service,
and not registered in the user’s session.
Display

Name
: Name of the RP application
Logo
: Logo of the RP application
Scope values content

When the
Always send exported attributes
option is disabled in
OpenID Connect Service
,
attributes can only be released if they are part of a scope.
By default, LL::NG will grant all requested scopes except if
Only allow declared scopes
option
is enabled in
OpenID Connect Service
.
In this case, only
standard OpenID Connect claims
are
exposed to applications. If you want to add non-standard attributes, you have
to create a new scope in the
Scope values content
section and your
application must request that scope.
By default, the following scope-to-attributes are already mapped by LL::NG:
Scope value
Attribute list
profile
name family_name given_name middle_name nickname preferred_username profile picture website gender birthdate zoneinfo locale updated_at
email
email email_verified
address
street_address locality region postal_code country
phone
phone_number phone_number_verified
If you want to expose custom attributes to OpenID Connect clients,
you have to declare them in a new scope in this section.
Add your additional scope as
Key
, and a space-separated list of
attributes as
Value
:
employment_info
=>
position company
In this example, an OpenID Connect client (RP) requesting for the
employment_info
scope will
be able to read the
company
and
position
attributes from the UserInfo endpoint.
Important
Any attribute defined in this section must be mapped to a
LL::NG session variable in
Exported Attributes
section
Important
Your custom attributes will only be visible if the application requests the
corresponding scope value, or if you use a Scope Rule to always enable that scope.
Scope rules

New in version 2.0.12.
This feature may change in a future version in a way that breaks
compatibility with existing configuration.
By default, LL::NG grants all scopes requested by the application, as
long as the user consents to them.
This configuration screen allows you to change that behavior by attaching
a rule
to a particular scope.
If the rule evaluates to true, the scope is added to the current request,
even if it was not requested by the application
If the rule evaluates to false, the scope is removed from the current request
Scopes which are not declared in the “Scope rules” list are left untouched
When writing scope rules, you can use the special
$requested
variable. This
variables evaluates to
true
within a scope rule when the corresponding scope
has been requested by the application. You can use this variable in a dynamic
rule when you only want to add a scope when the application requested it.
Examples:
read
:
inGroup('readers')
the
read
scope will be granted if the user is a member of the
readers
group even if the application did not request it.
write
:
$requested
and
inGroup('writers')
the
write
scope will be granted if the user is a member of the
writers
group, but only if the application requested it.
Access rule extra variables

When writing your access rules, you can additionally use the following variables:
$_oidc_grant_type
(since version
2.0.14
): the grant type being used to
access this service. Possible values:
authorizationcode
,
implicit
,
hybrid
,
clientcredentials
,
password
The following attributes are made available in the created session:
The
_whatToTrace
attribute (main session identifier), is set to the
relying party’s Client ID
The
_scope
attribute is set to the requested scopes
The
_clientId
attribute is set to the Client ID that obtained the access
token.
The
_clientConfKey
attribute is set to the LemonLDAP::NG configuration
key for the client that obtained the access token.
The
Access Rule
, if defined, will have access to those variables, as well as
the
@ENV
array. You can use it to restrict the use of this grant to
pre-determined scopes, a particular IP address, etc.
These session attributes will be released on the UserInfo endpoint if they are
mapped to
Exported Attributes
and
Extra Claims
.
Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant allows you to exchange a user’s login and password for an access token. This must be considered a legacy form of authentication, since the Authorization Code web-based flow is prefered for all applications that support it. It can however be useful in some scenarios involving technical accounts that cannot implement a web-based authentication flow.
Changed in version 2.0.12:
When using the
Choice
authentication module, the
Choice used for password authentication
setting can be used for selecting which authentication choice is used by the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant. Naturally, the selected choice must be a password-based authentication method (LDAP, DBI, REST, etc.).
See also
Specification for the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant:
RFC 6749#section-4.3
Client Credentials Grant

The Client Credentials Grant allows you to obtain an Access Token using only a Relying Party’s Client ID and Client Secret.

Specification for the Client Credentials Grant:
RFC 6749#section-4.4
