OpenID Connect
    Basic Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 - draft 47
Abstract
OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
      protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
      on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
      obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and
      REST-like manner.
This OpenID Connect Basic Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the
	OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification
	that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
	This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core
	specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications
	should instead consult the Core specification.

Introduction
This OpenID Connect Basic Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the
OpenID Connect Core 1.0
(
Sakimura, N., Bradley, J., Jones, M., de Medeiros, B., and C. Mortimore, “OpenID Connect Core 1.0,” December 2023.
)
[OpenID.Core] specification
	that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth 2.0
[RFC6749]
(
Hardt, D., Ed., “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework,” October 2012.
)
Authorization Code Flow.
	This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core
	specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
	Should there be any conflicts between the contents of this implementer's guide
	and the OpenID Connect Core specification, the latter takes precedence.
See the
OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide 1.0
(
Sakimura, N., Bradley, J., Jones, M., de Medeiros, B., and C. Mortimore, “OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide 1.0,” December 2023.
)
[OpenID.Implicit]
	for a related guide for basic
	Web-based Relying Parties using the
	OAuth Implicit Flow.
	OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications
	should instead consult the Core specification.
	This guide omits implementation and security
	considerations for OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications.
As background,
	the
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework
(
Hardt, D., Ed., “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework,” October 2012.
)
[RFC6749]
	and
OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
(
Jones, M. and D. Hardt, “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage,” October 2012.
)
[RFC6750]
	specifications provide a general framework for third-party applications
	to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.  They define
	mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources but
	do not define standard methods to provide identity information.
	Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of
	providing information about the authentication of an End-User.
	Readers are expected to be familiar with these specifications.
OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the
	OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
	Use of this extension is requested by Clients by including
	the
openid
scope value
	in the Authorization Request.
	An Authorization Request using these extensions
	is called an Authentication Request.
Information about the authentication performed is returned
	in a
JSON Web Token (JWT)
(
Jones, M., Bradley, J., and N. Sakimura, “JSON Web Token (JWT),” May 2015.
)
[JWT]
	called an ID Token (see
Section 2.2
(
ID Token
)
).
	OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs).
	OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).
This specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	configuration information about the OpenID Provider, including its
	Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint locations.
	This information is normally obtained via Discovery,
	as described in
OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
(
Sakimura, N., Bradley, J., Jones, M., and E. Jay, “OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0,” December 2023.
)
[OpenID.Discovery],
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
Likewise, this specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	sufficient credentials and provided information needed to use the OpenID Provider.
	This is normally done via Dynamic Registration,
	as described in
OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0
(
Sakimura, N., Bradley, J., and M. Jones, “OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0,” December 2023.
)
[OpenID.Registration],
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.

Requirements Notation and Conventions
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119]
(
Bradner, S., “Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,” March 1997.
)
.
In the .txt version of this specification,
	  values are quoted to indicate that they are to be taken literally.
	  When using these values in protocol messages,
	  the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.
	  In the HTML version of this specification,
	  values to be taken literally are indicated by
	  the use of
this fixed-width font
.
All uses of
JSON Web Signature (JWS)
(
Jones, M., Bradley, J., and N. Sakimura, “JSON Web Signature (JWS),” May 2015.
)
[JWS]
	  data structures in this specification utilize
	  the JWS Compact Serialization;
	  the JWS JSON Serialization is not used.
When the RFC 2119 language applies to the behavior of OpenID Providers,
	  it is in this specification for explanatory value to help Client
	  implementers understand the expected behavior of OpenID Providers.

Overview
The OpenID Connect protocol, in abstract, follows the following
	steps.
The RP (Client) sends a request to the OpenID Provider (OP).
The OP authenticates the End-User and obtains authorization.
The OP responds with an ID Token and usually an Access Token.
The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the UserInfo Endpoint.
The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.
These steps are illustrated in the following diagram:

Protocol Elements
Authentication Requests can follow one of three paths:
	the Authorization Code Flow,
	the Implicit Flow, or
	the Hybrid Flow.
	The Authorization Code Flow is
	intended for Clients that can securely maintain a Client Secret between
	themselves and the Authorization Server, whereas the Implicit Flow is
	intended for Clients that cannot.
	However, the Authorization Code flow is sometimes also used by Native applications
	and other Clients in order to be able to obtain a Refresh Token,
	even when they cannot ensure the secrecy of the Client Secret value.
	The Hybrid Flow combines aspects of the Authorization Code Flow
	and the Implicit Flow.
	It enables Clients to obtain an ID Token and optionally an Access Token with only
	one round trip to the Authorization Server, possibly minimizing latency,
	while still enabling Clients to later get tokens from the Token Endpoint
	-- especially a Refresh Token.
This specification only provides information that is sufficient for
	basic Clients using the Code Flow.
TOC
2.1. 
Code Flow
The Code Flow consists of the following steps:
Client prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired
            request parameters.
Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.
Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with
code
.
Client sends the
code
to the
	    Token Endpoint to receive an Access Token and ID Token in the response.
Client validates the tokens and retrieves the End-User's
	    Subject Identifier.
TOC
2.1.1. 
Client Prepares Authentication Request
When the RP wishes to Authenticate the End-User
	    or determine whether the End-User is already Authenticated,
	    the Client prepares an Authentication Request
	    to be sent to the Authorization Endpoint.
Communication with the Authorization Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.
	    See
Section 6.1
(
TLS Requirements
)
for more information on using TLS.
Clients MAY construct the request using the HTTP
GET
or the HTTP
POST
method as defined in
RFC 7231
(
Fielding, R., Ed. and J. Reschke, Ed., “Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content,” June 2014.
)
[RFC7231].
If using the HTTP
GET
method, the
          parameters are serialized using
	  the Query String Serialization, per
Section 3.1
(
Query String Serialization
)
.
	  If using the HTTP
POST
method, the request parameters are
          added to the HTTP request entity-body using the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
format
          as defined by
[W3C.SPSD‑html401‑20180327]
(
, “HTML 4.01 Specification,” March 2018.
)
.
The following is a non-normative example of an
            Authentication Request URL
	    (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
https://server.example.com/authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3

    &scope=openid%20profile
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
TOC
2.1.1.1. 
Request Parameters
This subset of
	      OpenID Connect uses the following OAuth 2.0 request parameters:
response_type
REQUIRED.
		  This value MUST be
code
.
		  This requests that both an Access Token and an ID Token be returned
		  from the Token Endpoint in exchange for
		  the
code
value returned from the
		  Authorization Endpoint.
client_id
REQUIRED.
		  OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier
		  valid at the Authorization Server.
scope
REQUIRED.
		  OpenID Connect requests MUST contain the
openid
scope value.
		  OPTIONAL scope values of
profile
,
email
,
address
,
phone
,
		  and
offline_access
are also defined.
		  See
Section 2.4
(
Scope Values
)
for more about the scope values defined by this specification.
redirect_uri
REQUIRED.
		  Redirection URI to which the response will be sent.
		  This URI MUST exactly match one of the Redirection URI values
		  for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider,
		  with the matching performed as described in
		  Section 6.2.1 of
[RFC3986]
(
Berners-Lee, T., Fielding, R., and L. Masinter, “Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,” January 2005.
)
(Simple String Comparison).
		  The Redirection URI
		  SHOULD use the
https
scheme;
		  however, it MAY use the
http
scheme,
		  provided that the Client Type is
confidential
,
		  as defined in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0, and
		  provided the OP allows the use of
http
Redirection URIs in this case.
		  Also, if the Client is a native application,
		  it MAY use the
http
scheme with
localhost
or the IP loopback literals
127.0.0.1
or
[::1]
as the hostname.
		  The Redirection URI MAY use an alternate scheme,
		  such as one that is intended to identify a callback into a native application.
state
RECOMMENDED.
		  Opaque value used
		  to maintain state between the request and the callback.
		  Typically, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF, XSRF)
		  mitigation is done by cryptographically binding the value of
		  this parameter with a browser cookie.
This specification also defines the following request parameters:
nonce
OPTIONAL.
		  String value used to associate a Client session
		  with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.
		  The value is passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request to the ID Token.
		  Sufficient entropy MUST be present in the
nonce
values used to prevent
		  attackers from guessing values.
		  One method to achieve this is to store a cryptographically random value
		  as an HttpOnly a session cookie and use a cryptographic hash of the value
		  as the
nonce
parameter.
		  In that case, the
nonce
in the returned
		  ID Token is compared to the hash of the session cookie
		  to detect ID Token replay by third parties.
		  Use of the nonce is OPTIONAL when using the code flow.
display
OPTIONAL.
		  ASCII
[RFC20]
(
Cerf, V., “ASCII format for Network Interchange,” October 1969.
)
string value that specifies
		  how the Authorization Server displays the authentication and
		  consent user interface pages to the End-User.
		  The defined values are:
page
The Authorization Server SHOULD display the
		      authentication and consent UI consistent with a full User Agent page
		      view. If the display parameter is not specified, this is the
		      default display mode.
popup
The Authorization Server SHOULD display the
		      authentication and consent UI consistent with a popup User Agent
		      window.
		      The popup User Agent window should be of an appropriate size
		      for a login-focused dialog and should not obscure
		      the entire window that it is popping up over.
touch
The Authorization Server SHOULD display the
		      authentication and consent UI consistent with a device that
		      leverages a touch interface.
wap
The Authorization Server SHOULD display the
		      authentication and consent UI consistent with a "feature phone"
		      type display.
The Authorization Server MAY also attempt to detect the capabilities
		  of the User Agent and present an appropriate display.
If an OP receives a
display
value
		  outside the set defined above that it does not understand,
		  it MAY return an error or it MAY ignore it;
		  in practice, not returning errors for not-understood values
		  will help facilitate phasing in extensions using new
display
values.
prompt
OPTIONAL.
		  Space-delimited, case-sensitive list of ASCII string values
		  that specifies whether the Authorization Server prompts
		  the End-User for reauthentication and consent.
		  The defined values are:
none
The Authorization Server
		      MUST NOT display any authentication or consent
		      user interface pages.
		      An error is returned
		      if an End-User
		      is not already authenticated or the Client does not have
		      pre-configured consent for the requested
		      Claims or does not fulfill other conditions for processing the request.
		      The error code will typically be
login_required
,
interaction_required
.
		      This can be used as a
		      method to check for existing authentication and/or consent.
login
The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the
		      End-User for reauthentication.
		      If it cannot reauthenticate the End-User, it MUST return an error,
		      typically
login_required
.
consent
The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for consent
		      before returning information to the Client.
		      If it cannot obtain consent, it MUST return an error,
		      typically
consent_required
.
select_account
The Authorization Server SHOULD
		      prompt the End-User to select a user account.  This enables
		      an End-User who has multiple accounts at the Authorization Server
		      to select amongst the multiple accounts that they might have
		      current sessions for.
		      If it cannot obtain an account selection choice made by the End-User,
		      it MUST return an error,
		      typically
account_selection_required
.
The
prompt
parameter
		  can be used by the Client to make sure that the End-User is
		  still present for the current session or to bring attention to the
		  request. If this parameter contains
none
with any other value, an
		  error is returned.
If an OP receives a
prompt
value
		  outside the set defined above that it does not understand,
		  it MAY return an error or it MAY ignore it;
		  in practice, not returning errors for not-understood values
		  will help facilitate phasing in extensions using new
prompt
values.
max_age
OPTIONAL.
		  Maximum Authentication Age.
		  Specifies the allowable elapsed time in seconds
		  since the last time the End-User was actively
		  authenticated by the OP. If the elapsed time is greater than
		  this value, the OP MUST attempt to actively
		  re-authenticate the End-User.
		  When
max_age
is used, the ID Token returned
		  MUST include an
auth_time
Claim Value.
		  Note that
max_age=0
is equivalent
		  to
prompt=login
.
ui_locales
OPTIONAL.
		  End-User's preferred languages and scripts for the user interface,
		  represented as a space-separated list of
BCP47
(
Phillips, A., Ed. and M. Davis, Ed., “Tags for Identifying Languages,” September 2009.
)
[RFC5646] language tag values,

                  For instance, the value "fr-CA fr en" represents a preference
                  for French as spoken in Canada,
		  then French (without a region designation),
                  followed by English (without a region designation).
		  An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
		  are not supported by the OpenID Provider.
claims_locales
OPTIONAL.
		  End-User's preferred languages and scripts for Claims being returned,
		  represented as a space-separated list of
BCP47
(
Phillips, A., Ed. and M. Davis, Ed., “Tags for Identifying Languages,” September 2009.
)
[RFC5646] language tag values,
		  ordered by preference.
		  An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
		  are not supported by the OpenID Provider.
id_token_hint
OPTIONAL.
		  ID Token previously issued by the Authorization Server
		  being passed as a hint about the End-User's current or past
		  authenticated session with the Client.
		  If the End-User identified by the ID Token is logged in or is logged in by the request,
		  then the Authorization Server returns a positive response;
		  otherwise, it SHOULD return
		  an error.
		  When possible, an
id_token_hint
SHOULD be present when
prompt=none
is used
		  and an
invalid_request
error
		  MAY be returned if it is not;
		  however, the server SHOULD respond successfully when possible,
		  even if it is not present.
		  The Authorization Server need not be listed as an
		  audience of the ID Token when it is used as an
id_token_hint
value.
login_hint
OPTIONAL.
		  Hint to the Authorization Server
		  about the login identifier the End-User might use to log in (if necessary).
		  This hint can be used by an RP if it first asks the End-User for their e-mail
		  address (or other identifier) and then wants to pass that value as a hint
		  to the discovered authorization service.
		  It is RECOMMENDED that the hint value match the value used for discovery.
		  This value MAY also be a phone number in the format specified for the
phone_number
Claim.
		  The use of this parameter is left to the OP's discretion.
acr_values
OPTIONAL.
                  Requested Authentication Context Class Reference values.
		  Space-separated string that specifies the
acr
values that the Authorization Server is being requested to use
		  for processing this authentication request,
		  with the values appearing in order of preference.
		  The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication
		  performed is returned as the
acr
Claim Value,
		  as specified in
Section 2.2
(
ID Token
)
.
		  The
acr
Claim is requested as
		  a Voluntary Claim by this parameter.

Client Sends Request to Authorization Server
Having constructed the Authentication Request, the Client sends it
          to the Authorization Endpoint using HTTPS.
The following is a non-normative example
	      HTTP 302 redirect response by the Client, which triggers
	      the User Agent to make an Authentication Request
	      to the Authorization Endpoint
	      (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://server.example.com/authorize?

2.1.3. 
Authorization Server Authenticates End-User
The Authorization Server logs in the End-User or verifies whether
	    the End-User is logged in, depending upon the request parameter values used.
	    If interaction with the End-User occurs over an HTTP channel,
	    it MUST use TLS, as per
Section 6.1
(
TLS Requirements
)
.
	    The exact authentication methods used are out of scope for this specification.
TOC
2.1.4. 
Authorization Server Obtains End-User Consent/Authorization
The Authorization Server obtains an authorization decision
          for the requested Claims. This can be done by presenting the End-User
          with a dialogue that enables the End-User to recognize what is being
          consenting to and grant consent or by establishing consent via
          other means (for example, via previous administrative consent).
The
openid
scope value declares
	    that this OAuth 2.0 request is an OpenID Connect request.
	    Use of all other scope values is OPTIONAL.

Client Obtains ID Token and Access Token
The Client then makes an Access Token Request using the
	    Authorization Code to obtain tokens from the Token Endpoint
	    in the following manner:
TOC
2.1.6.1. 
Client Sends Code
A Client makes a Token Request by
	      presenting its Authorization Grant (in the form of
	      an Authorization Code) to the Token Endpoint
	      using the
grant_type
value
authorization_code
, as described in
	      Section 4.1.3 of
OAuth 2.0
(
Hardt, D., Ed., “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework,” October 2012.
)
[RFC6749].
	      The Client MUST authenticate to the Token Endpoint using the HTTP Basic method,
	      as described in Section 2.3.1 of OAuth 2.0.
	      (This method is the one identified by using the
client_secret_basic
Client Authentication method value

OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
(
Sakimura, N., Bradley, J., Jones, M., and E. Jay, “OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0,” December 2023.

[OpenID.Discovery]).
The Client sends the parameters to the Token Endpoint
	      using the HTTP
POST
method and the
	      Form Serialization, per
Section 3.2
(
Form Serialization

2.2. 
ID Token
The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims about the
	  authentication of an End-User by an Authorization Server when using a Client,
	  and potentially other requested Claims.
	  The ID Token is represented as a
JSON Web Token (JWT)
(
Jones, M., Bradley, J., and N. Sakimura, “JSON Web Token (JWT),” May 2015.
)
[JWT].
The following Claims are used within the ID Token:
iss
REQUIRED.
	      Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response.
	      The
iss
value is a case-sensitive URL
	      using the
https
scheme that
	      contains scheme, host, and optionally, port number and path
	      components and no query or fragment components.
sub
REQUIRED.
	      Subject Identifier.  Locally unique and never
	      reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User,
	      which is intended to be consumed by the Client,
	      e.g.,
24400320
or
AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4
.
	      It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length.
	      The
sub
value is a case-sensitive string.
aud
REQUIRED.
	      Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for.
	      It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0
client_id
of the Relying Party as an audience value.
	      It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences.
	      In the general case,
	      the
aud
value is an array of
	      case-sensitive strings.
	      In the common special case when there is one audience,
	      the
aud
value MAY be a single
	      case-sensitive string.
exp
REQUIRED.
	      Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be
	      accepted for processing. The processing of this parameter
	      requires that the current date/time MUST be before the
	      expiration date/time listed in the value. Implementers MAY
	      provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few
	      minutes, to account for clock skew.
	      Its value is a JSON
[RFC8259]
(
Bray, T., Ed., “The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format,” December 2017.
)
number representing the number of seconds from
	      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
	      See
RFC 3339
(
Klyne, G. and C. Newman, “Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps,” July 2002.
)
[RFC3339]
	      for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in
	      particular.
iat
REQUIRED.
	      Time at which the JWT was issued.
	      Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from
	      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
auth_time
Time when the End-User authentication occurred.
	      Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from
	      1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
	      When a
max_age
request is made
	      then this Claim is REQUIRED; otherwise, its inclusion is OPTIONAL.
nonce
OPTIONAL.
	      String value used to associate a Client session
	      with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.
	      The value is passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request to the ID Token.
	      The Client MUST verify that
	      the
nonce
Claim Value is equal to
	      the value of the
nonce
parameter sent in the Authentication Request.
	      If present in the Authentication Request, Authorization Servers
	      MUST include a
nonce
Claim in the
	      ID Token with the Claim Value
	      being the nonce value sent in the Authentication Request.
	      The
nonce
value is a case-sensitive string.
at_hash
OPTIONAL.
	      Access Token hash value.
	      This is OPTIONAL when the ID Token is issued from the Token Endpoint,
	      which is the case for this subset of OpenID Connect; nonetheless,
	      an
at_hash
Claim MAY be present.
	      Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the
	      hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the
access_token
value,
	      where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm
	      used in the
alg
Header Parameter
	      of the ID Token's JOSE Header.
	      For instance, if the
alg
is
RS256
, hash the
access_token
value
	      with SHA-256, then take the left-most 128 bits and base64url-encode them.
	      The
at_hash
value is a case-sensitive string.
acr
OPTIONAL.
	      Authentication Context Class Reference.
	      String specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference value
	      that identifies the Authentication Context Class that the
	      authentication performed satisfied.
	      The value "0" indicates the End-User authentication
	      did not meet the requirements of
ISO/IEC 29115
(
International Organization for Standardization, “ISO/IEC 29115:2013.           Information technology - Security techniques - Entity authentication           assurance framework,” April 2013.
)
[ISO29115] level 1.
	      For historic reasons, the value "0" is used to indicate that
	      there is no confidence that the same person is actually there.
	      Authentications with
	      level 0 SHOULD NOT be used to authorize access to any resource of any
	      monetary value.
	      An absolute URI or an

acr
value;
	      registered names MUST NOT be used with a different meaning than
	      that which is registered.
	      Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of
	      the values used, which may be context specific.
	      The
acr
value is a case-sensitive string.
amr
OPTIONAL.
	      Authentication Methods References.
	      JSON array of strings that are identifiers for authentication methods
	      used in the authentication.
	      For instance, values might indicate that both password and OTP
	      authentication methods were used.
	      The
amr
value is an array of
	      case-sensitive strings.
	      Values used in the
amr
Claim
	      SHOULD be from those registered in the
	      IANA Authentication Method Reference Values registry
[IANA.AMR]
(
IANA, “Authentication Method Reference Values,” .
)
established by
[RFC8176]
(
Jones, M., Hunt, P., and A. Nadalin, “Authentication Method Reference Values,” June 2017.
)
;
	      parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of
	      any unregistered values used, which may be context specific.
ID Tokens MAY contain other Claims.
	  Any Claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored.
ID Tokens SHOULD NOT use the JWS or JWE
x5u
,
x5c
,
jku
, or
jwk
Header Parameter fields.
	  Instead, keys used for ID Tokens are
	  communicated in advance using Discovery and Registration parameters.
The following is a non-normative example of
	    the set of Claims (the JWT Claims Set) base64url-decoded from an ID Token:
{
   "iss": "https://server.example.com",

   "exp": 1311281970,
   "iat": 1311280970
  }

2.2.1. 
ID Token Validation
If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification fail, any operations requiring
	    the information that failed to correctly validate MUST be aborted and
	    the information that failed to validate MUST NOT be used.
The Client MUST validate the ID Token in the Token Response.  To do this,
	  the Client can split the ID Token at the
	  period (".") characters, take the second segment, and base64url decode it to
	  obtain a JSON object containing the ID Token Claims, which MUST be validated
	  as follows:
The Issuer Identifier for the OpenID Provider
		(which is typically obtained during Discovery)
		MUST exactly match the value of the
iss
(issuer) Claim.
The Client MUST validate that the
aud
(audience) Claim
		contains its
client_id
value
		registered at the Issuer identified by the
iss
(issuer) Claim
		as an audience.
		The ID Token MUST be rejected if the ID Token does not list
		the Client as a valid audience, or if it contains additional audiences not trusted by the Client.
The current time MUST be before the time represented by the
exp
Claim
		(possibly allowing for some small leeway to account for clock skew).
The
iat
Claim can be used to reject tokens that
	      were issued too far away from the current time, limiting the amount of
	      time that nonces need to be stored to prevent attacks.
	      The acceptable range is Client specific.
If the
acr
Claim was requested, the
	      Client SHOULD check that the asserted Claim Value is appropriate.
	      The meaning and processing of
acr
Claim Values is out of scope for this specification.
When a
max_age
request is made,
		the Client SHOULD check the
auth_time
Claim
		value and request re-authentication if it determines too much time
		has elapsed since the last End-User authentication.

UserInfo Endpoint
The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that
	  returns Claims about the authenticated End-User.
	  The location of the UserInfo Endpoint MUST be
	  a URL using the
https
scheme, which MAY contain
	  port, path, and query parameter components.
	  The returned Claims are
	  represented by a JSON object that contains a collection of
	  name and value pairs for the Claims.
Communication with the UserInfo Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.

2.3.2. 
Successful UserInfo Response
The UserInfo Claims MUST be returned as the members of a JSON object.
	    The response body SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8.
	    The Claims defined in
Section 2.5
(
Standard Claims
)
can be returned,
	    as can additional Claims not specified there.
If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be
            omitted from the JSON object representing the Claims; it
            SHOULD NOT be present with a null or empty string value.
The
sub
(subject) Claim
	    MUST always be returned in the UserInfo Response.
NOTE:  Due to the possibility of token substitution attacks,
	    the UserInfo Response is not guaranteed to be about the
	    End-User identified by the
sub
(subject)
	    element of the ID Token.
	    The
sub
Claim in the UserInfo Response
	    MUST be verified to exactly match the
sub
Claim in the ID Token;
	    if they do not match, the UserInfo Response values MUST NOT be used.
The Client MUST verify that the OP that responded was
	    the intended OP through a TLS server certificate check,
	    per
RFC 6125

Scope Values
OpenID Connect Clients use
scope
values as defined in Section 3.3 of
OAuth 2.0
(
Hardt, D., Ed., “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework,” October 2012.
)
[RFC6749] to specify what
        access privileges are being requested for Access Tokens. The scopes associated
        with Access Tokens determine what resources will be available when they are
        used to access OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints. For OpenID Connect, scopes
	can be used to request that specific sets of information
	be made available as Claim Values.
        This specification describes only the scope values used by OpenID Connect.
OpenID Connect allows additional scope values to be defined and used.
	  Scope values used that are not understood by an implementation SHOULD be ignored.
Claims requested by the following scopes are treated by Authorization Servers
	  as Voluntary Claims.
OpenID Connect defines the following
scope
values:
openid
REQUIRED. Informs the Authorization Server
	      that the Client is making an OpenID Connect request. If the
openid
scope value is not present,
	      the behavior is entirely unspecified.

OPTIONAL. This scope value requests
	      that an OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token be issued that can be used to
	      obtain an Access Token that grants access to the End-User's
	      UserInfo Endpoint even when the End-User is not present (not logged in).
Multiple scope values MAY be used by creating a space-delimited,
	  case-sensitive list of ASCII scope values.
The Claims requested by the

scope values
	  are returned from the UserInfo Endpoint,
	  as described in
Section 2.3.2
(

)
.
In some cases, the End-User will be given the option to
        have the OpenID Provider decline to provide some or all
        information requested by RPs.
        To minimize the amount of information that the End-User is being asked
	to disclose, an RP can elect to
        only request a subset of the information available from the
        UserInfo Endpoint.

Standard Claims
This subset of OpenID Connect defines a set of standard Claims.
	They are returned in the UserInfo Response.
Member
Type
Description
sub
string
Subject - Identifier for the End-User at the Issuer.
name
string
End-User's full name in displayable form including all name parts,
	    possibly including titles and suffixes,
	    ordered according to the End-User's locale and preferences.
given_name
string
Given name(s) or first name(s) of the End-User.
	    Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple given names;
	    all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.
family_name
string
Surname(s) or last name(s) of the End-User.
	    Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple family names
	    or no family name;
	    all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.
middle_name
string
Middle name(s) of the End-User.
	    Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple middle names;
	    all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.
	    Also note that in some cultures, middle names are not used.
nickname
string
Casual name of the End-User that may or may not be the same as the
given_name
. For instance, a
nickname
value of
Mike
might be returned alongside a
given_name
value of
Michael
.
preferred_username
string
Shorthand name by which the End-User wishes to be referred to at the RP, such as
janedoe
or
j.doe
.
	  This value MAY be any valid JSON string including
	  special characters such as
@
,
/
, or whitespace.
	  The RP MUST NOT rely upon this value being unique,
	  as discussed in
Section 2.5.3
(
Claim Stability and Uniqueness
)
.
profile
string
URL of the End-User's profile page.
	    The contents of this Web page SHOULD be about the End-User.
picture
string
URL of the End-User's profile picture.
	    This URL MUST refer to an image file
	    (for example, a PNG, JPEG, or GIF image file),
	    rather than to a Web page containing an image.
	    Note that this URL SHOULD specifically reference
	    a profile photo of the End-User
	    suitable for displaying when describing the End-User,
	    rather than an arbitrary photo taken by the End-User.
website
string
URL of the End-User's Web page or blog.
	    This Web page SHOULD contain information published by the End-User
	    or an organization that the End-User is affiliated with.
email
string
End-User's preferred e-mail address.
	    Its value MUST conform to the
RFC 5322
(
Resnick, P., Ed., “Internet Message Format,” October 2008.

	    addr-spec syntax.
	    The RP MUST NOT rely upon this value being unique,
	    as discussed in
Section 2.5.3
(
Claim Stability and Uniqueness
)
.
email_verified
boolean
True if the End-User's e-mail address has been verified; otherwise false.
	    When this Claim Value is
true
,
	    this  means that the OP took affirmative steps
	    to ensure that this e-mail address was controlled by the End-User
	    at the time the verification was performed.
	    The means by which an e-mail address is verified is context specific,
	    and dependent upon the trust framework or contractual agreements
	    within which the parties are operating.
gender
string
End-User's gender.  Values defined by this specification
	  are
female
and
male
.  Other values MAY be used
	  when neither of the defined values are applicable.
birthdate
string
End-User's birthday, represented as an
ISO 8601-1
(
International Organization for 	    Standardization, “ISO 8601-1:2019/Amd 1:2022. Date and time - Representations for information interchange - Part 1: Basic rules,” October 2022.
)
[ISO8601‑1]
YYYY-MM-DD
format. The year MAY be
0000
, indicating that it is omitted.
	  To represent only the year,
YYYY
format is allowed. Note that
	  depending on the underlying platform's date related function, providing just year can
	  result in varying month and day, so the implementers need to take this factor into account
	  to correctly process the dates.
zoneinfo
string
String from IANA Time Zone Database
[IANA.time‑zones]
(
IANA, “Time Zone Database,” .
)
representing the End-User's time zone.
	  For example,
Europe/Paris
or
America/Los_Angeles
.
locale
string
End-User's locale, represented as a
BCP47
(
Phillips, A., Ed. and M. Davis, Ed., “Tags for Identifying Languages,” September 2009.
)
[RFC5646] language tag.
	  This is typically an
ISO 639 Alpha-2
(
International Organization for 	    Standardization, “ISO 639:2023. Code for individual languages and language groups,” November 2023.
)
[ISO639]
	  language code in
	  lowercase and an
ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2
(
International Organization for 	    Standardization, “ISO 3166-1:2020. Codes for the representation of names of 	  countries and their subdivisions - Part 1: Country codes,” August 2020.
)
[ISO3166‑1]
	  country code in uppercase, separated by a dash. For example,
en-US
or
fr-CA
.
	  As a compatibility note, some implementations have used an underscore
	  as the separator rather than a dash, for example,
en_US
; Relying Parties MAY choose to
	  accept this locale syntax as well.
phone_number
string
End-User's preferred telephone number.
E.164
(
International Telecommunication Union, “E.164: The international public telecommunication numbering plan,” 2010.
)
[E.164]
	    is RECOMMENDED as the format of this Claim,
	    for example,
+1 (425) 555-1212
or
+56 (2) 687 2400
.
	    If the phone number contains an extension, it is RECOMMENDED that
	    the extension be represented using the
RFC 3966
(
Schulzrinne, H., “The tel URI for Telephone Numbers,” December 2004.
)
[RFC3966] extension syntax,
	    for example,
+1 (604) 555-1234;ext=5678
.
phone_number_verified
boolean
True if the End-User's phone number has been verified; otherwise false.
	    When this Claim Value is
true
,
	    this  means that the OP took affirmative steps
	    to ensure that this phone number was controlled by the End-User
	    at the time the verification was performed.
	    The means by which a phone number is verified is context specific,
	    and dependent upon the trust framework or contractual agreements
	    within which the parties are operating.
	    When true, the
phone_number
Claim MUST be in E.164 format
	    and any extensions MUST be represented in RFC 3966 format.
address
JSON object
End-User's preferred postal address.
	    The value of the
address
member is
	    a JSON
[RFC8259]
(
Bray, T., Ed., “The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format,” December 2017.
)
structure containing some or all of
	    the members defined in
Section 2.5.1
(
Address Claim
)
.
updated_at
number
Time the End-User's information was last updated.
	    Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from
	    1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
Table 1: Reserved Member Definitions
Following is a non-normative example of such
	  a response:
{
   "sub": "248289761001",
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "preferred_username": "j.doe",
   "email": "janedoe@example.com",
   "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
  }
The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return Claims in JSON format unless a
	different format was specified during Registration
[OpenID.Registration]
(
Sakimura, N., Bradley, J., and M. Jones, “OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0,” December 2023.
)
.
	The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return a content-type header to indicate
	which format is being returned. The following are accepted content
	types:
Content-Type
Format Returned
application/json
plain text JSON object
application/jwt
JSON Web Token (JWT)
TOC
2.5.1. 
Address Claim
The Address Claim represents a physical mailing address.
	    Implementations MAY return only a subset of the
	    fields of an
address
, depending upon
	    the information available and the End-User's privacy
	    preferences. For
	    example, the
country
and
region
might be returned without returning
	    more fine-grained address information.
Implementations MAY return just the full address
	    as a single string in the formatted sub-field,
	    or they MAY return just the individual component
	    fields using the other sub-fields,
	    or they MAY return both.
	    If both variants are returned,
	    they SHOULD represent the same address,
	    with the formatted address indicating how the
	    component fields are combined.
All the address values defined below are represented as JSON strings.
formatted
Full mailing address,
		formatted for display or use on a mailing label.
		This field MAY contain multiple lines, separated by newlines.
		Newlines can be represented either as
		a carriage return/line feed pair ("\r\n") or as
		a single line feed character ("\n").
street_address
Full street address component,
		which MAY include house number, street name,
		Post Office Box, and multi-line extended street
		address information.
		This field MAY contain multiple lines, separated by newlines.
		Newlines can be represented either as
		a carriage return/line feed pair ("\r\n") or as
		a single line feed character ("\n").
locality
City or locality component.
region
State, province,
		prefecture, or region component.
postal_code
Zip code or
		postal code component.
country
Country name component.
TOC
2.5.2. 
Claims Languages and Scripts
Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-readable values
	    MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
	    To specify the languages and scripts,
BCP47
(
Phillips, A., Ed. and M. Davis, Ed., “Tags for Identifying Languages,” September 2009.
)
[RFC5646] language tags are added to member names,
	    delimited by a
#
character.  For example,
family_name#ja-Kana-JP
expresses the
	    Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index
	    and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same name
	    represented as
family_name#ja-Hani-JP
.
	    As another example, both
website
and
website#de
Claim Values might be returned,
	    referencing a Web site in an unspecified language and a Web site
	    in German.
Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
	    that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
	    character case with which they are registered in the
	    IANA "Language Subtag Registry"
[IANA.Language]
(
IANA, “Language Subtag Registry,” .
)
.
	    In particular, normally language names are spelled with lowercase characters,
	    region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
	    scripts are spelled with mixed case characters.
	    However, since BCP47 language tag values are case insensitive,
	    implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values supplied
	    in a case-insensitive manner.
Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
	    SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.
	    For instance, using
fr
might be sufficient
	    in many contexts, rather than
fr-CA
or
fr-FR
.
	    Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
	    Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with
	    a
de
(German) language tag and the OP
	    has a value tagged with
de-CH
(Swiss German)
	    and no generic German value, it would be appropriate for the OP
	    to return the Swiss German value to the Client.
	    (This intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
	    matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)
A
claims_locales
request can be used to
	    specify the preferred languages and scripts to use for the returned Claims.
When the OP determines, either through the
claims_locales
parameter,
	    or by other means, that the End-User and Client are
	    requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts,
	    it is RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags
	    when they employ this language and script.
	    It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner
	    that they can handle and utilize Claims using language tags.
TOC
2.5.3. 
Claim Stability and Uniqueness
The
sub
(subject) and
iss
(issuer) Claims, used together,
	    are the only Claims that an RP
	    can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User,
	    since the
sub
Claim MUST be locally unique and never reassigned within the Issuer
	    for a particular End-User, as described in
Section 2.2
(
ID Token
)
.
	    Therefore, the only guaranteed unique identifier for a given End-User is the
	    combination of the
iss
Claim
	    and the
sub
Claim.
All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers in terms of
	    stability over time or uniqueness across users, and Issuers are permitted to
	    apply local restrictions and policies. For instance, an Issuer MAY re-use an
email
Claim Value across different
	    End-Users at different points in time, and the claimed
email
address for a given End-User MAY change
	    over time.
	    Therefore, other Claims such as
email
,
phone_number
, and
preferred_username
and MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for the End-User.

Serializations
A request message MAY be serialized using one of the following methods:
Query String Serialization
Form Serialization
TOC
3.1. 
Query String Serialization
In order to serialize the parameters using the Query String
	Serialization, the Client constructs the string by adding the
	parameters and values to the query component using the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
format as
	defined by
[W3C.SPSD‑html401‑20180327]
(
, “HTML 4.01 Specification,” March 2018.
)
.
	Query String Serialization is typically used in
	HTTP
GET
requests.
Following is a non-normative example of this serialization
	    (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
GET /authorize?scope=openid
    &response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
TOC
3.2. 
Form Serialization
Parameters and their values are Form Serialized by adding the
	parameter names and values to the entity body of the HTTP request using
	the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
format
	as defined by
[W3C.SPSD‑html401‑20180327]
(
, “HTML 4.01 Specification,” March 2018.
)
.
	Form Serialization is typically used in HTTP
POST
requests.
Following is a non-normative example of this serialization
	    (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  scope=openid
    &response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
TOC
4. 
String Operations
Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing
	values in the messages to known values. For example, the Claim
	Names returned by the UserInfo Endpoint might be compared to
	specific Claim Names such as
sub
.  Comparing Unicode
[UNICODE]
(
The Unicode Consortium, “The Unicode Standard,” .
)
strings,
	however, has significant security implications.
Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode
	strings MUST be performed as specified below:
Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of
	    Unicode code points.
Unicode Normalization
[USA15]
(
Whistler, K., “Unicode Normalization Forms,” August 2023.
)
MUST NOT
	    be applied at any point to either the JSON string or to
	    the string it is to be compared against.
Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
	    Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.
In several places, this specification uses space-delimited
	lists of strings.  In all such cases, the ASCII space
	character (0x20) MUST be the only character used for this purpose.

Implementation Considerations
This specification defines features used by Relying Parties
	using the OAuth Authorization Code Flow.
	These Relying Parties MUST implement the features that are listed
	in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST".
TOC
5.1. 
Discovery and Registration
Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set of
	OpenID Providers and/or Relying Parties. In those cases, it might not be
	necessary to support dynamic discovery of information about identities
	or services or dynamic registration of Clients.
However, if installations choose to support unanticipated
	interactions between Relying Parties and OpenID Providers that do not
	have pre-configured relationships, they SHOULD accomplish this by
	implementing the facilities defined in the
OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0

TLS Requirements
Implementations MUST support TLS.
	  Which version(s) ought to be implemented will vary over
	  time and depend on the widespread deployment and known
	  security vulnerabilities at the time of implementation.
	  Implementations SHOULD follow the guidance in
	  BCP 195
[RFC8996]
(
Moriarty, K. and S. Farrell, “Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1,” March 2021.
)
[RFC9325]
(
Sheffer, Y., Saint-Andre, P., and T. Fossati, “Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS),” November 2022.
)
,
	  which provides recommendations and requirements
	  for improving the security of deployed services that use TLS.
To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
	  confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS
	  with a ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and
	  integrity protection.
Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check
	  MUST be performed, per
RFC 6125
(
Saint-Andre, P. and J. Hodges, “Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS),” March 2011.

Privacy Considerations
TOC
7.1. 
Personally Identifiable Information
The UserInfo Response typically contains Personally Identifiable
	Information (PII). As such, End-User consent for the release of the information
	for the specified purpose SHOULD be obtained at or prior to the
	authorization time in accordance with relevant regulations. The purpose
	of use is typically registered in association with the
redirect_uris
.
Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored at the Client and the
	Client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use
	statement.
TOC
7.2. 
Data Access Monitoring
The Resource Server SHOULD make End-Users' UserInfo access logs
	  available to them so that they can monitor who accessed their data.
TOC
7.3. 
Correlation
To protect the End-User from possible correlation among Clients, the
	use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) as the
sub
(subject) SHOULD be considered.
TOC
7.4. 
Offline Access
Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
	  posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is present.
	  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
	  offline access to resources.
	  This specification mandates the use of the
prompt
parameter to obtain consent unless it is already known that the
	  request complies with the conditions for processing the request in each jurisdiction.
When an Access Token is returned in the front channel, there is
	  a greater risk of it being exposed to an attacker, who could
	  later use it to access the UserInfo endpoint.
	  If the Access Token does not enable offline access and the server
	  can differentiate whether the Client request has been made
	  offline or online, the risk will be substantially reduced.
	  Therefore, this specification mandates ignoring
	  the offline access request when the Access Token is
	  transmitted in the front channel.
	  Note that differentiating between online and offline access
	  from the server can be difficult especially for native clients.
	  The server may well have to rely on heuristics.
	  Also, the risk of exposure for the Access Token delivered
	  in the front channel for the Response Types of
code token
and
token
is the same.
	  Thus, the implementations should be prepared to detect the
	  channel from which the Access Token was issued and deny offline access
	  if the token was issued in the front channel.
Note that although these provisions require an explicit
	  consent dialogue through the
prompt
parameter,
	  the mere fact that the user pressed an "accept" button etc.,
	  might not constitute a valid consent.
	  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
	  be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be
	  understood by the End-User, the consent must be freely given
	  and not forced (i.e., other options have to be available),
	  and the terms must fair and equitable.
	  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
	  required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on
	  other conditions for processing the request than simply explicit consent,
	  as online self-service "explicit consent" often does not
	  form a valid consent in some jurisdictions.

-09
Clean up typos.
Clean up scope explanation.
Fix 3.2.4.1 to include id_token in response.
-08
Added note about OP needing to read the full spec.
Reverted back to GET for introspection based on Google
          feedback.
Changed scopes to
openid
,
profile
,
address
,
          and
email
to make them additive.
Changed introspection to Check Session Endpoint to be consistent
          with session management.
Changed validation rules, the Check session endpoint will return
          an error for expired or invalid tokens, so the Client does not need
          to check expiration.
Added explanation of why an id_token is used to verify identity
          rather than the userinfo Access Token.
-07
Changed introspection to post
Changed userinfo from
id
to
user_id
to be consistent with introspection
          endpoint.
Fixed introspection example to use id_token rather than access
          token.
Removed asking for id_token in response type.
Fixed Section 3 to be clear it is client secret that is maintained
          between the client and the OP.
-06
Only require the
token
flow in Lite.
          Removed
code
flow.
Make
id_token
required. The
id_token
is treated as opaque.
Rearranged sections for readability.
Dropped the
schema
parameter to the
          Introspection endpoint, which was formerly a string with the value
user_id
. This is unnecessary since the
id_token
parameter already can be used
          to disambiguate the intended uses(s) of the endpoint.
Dropped the requested audience from the Lite spec, which was
          formerly the identifier of the target audience of the response. This
          could be part of the Standard spec, but is an advanced scenario, and
          so not appropriate for Lite.
Reference the Discovery and Registration specs, since they're
          needed for interaction between non-pre-configured parties (so that
          OpenID Connect installations can be Open).
-05
Corrected issues raised by Casper Biering.
Created the OpenID Connect Lite specification.
-04
Correct issues raised by Pam Dingle and discussed on the mailing
          list after the 7-Jul-11 working group call.
Adopted long_names.
-03
Correct issues raised by Johnny Bufu and discussed on the
          7-Jul-11 working group call.
-02
Consistency and cleanup pass, including removing unused
          references.
